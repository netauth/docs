## netauth entity key

Manage keys on an entity

### Synopsis



The keys command manages the keys that are stored directly on an
entity.  Since the metadata for entities is public it is important to
only ever store *public* keys on the entity.  Most commonly this
feature would be used to store SSH keys that should be trusted across
the network.

The default key type is always SSH, and keys are matched exactly.  It
can be useful to copy and paste a key from the list output to remove
it.

```
netauth entity key [flags]
```

### Examples

```
$ netauth entity key add SSH "ssh-rsa this-is-too-short-but-whatever root@everywhere"
$ netauth entity key read
Type: SSH; Key: ssh-rsa this-is-too-short-but-whatever root@everywhere
$ netauth entity key drop "ssh-rsa this-is-too-short-but-whatever root@everywhere"
$ netauth entity key read

```

### Options
