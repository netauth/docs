## netauth group create

Create a new group

### Synopsis


Create an group with the specified name.  Though there are no strict
requirements on the name beyond it being a single word that is
globally unique, it is strongly encouraged to make it exclusively of
lower case letters and numbers.  For the best compatibility, it is
recommended to start with a letter only.

Additional fields can be specified on the command line such as the
display name, or a group to defer management capability to.  If
desired a custom number can be provided, but the default behavior is
sufficient to select a valid unallocated number for the new group.

The caller must possess the CREATE_GROUP capability or be a GLOBAL_ROOT
operator for this command to succeed.

```
netauth group create <name> [flags]
```
